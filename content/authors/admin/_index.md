I am Aseem Deodhar. My interests range from debating gentrification theory to trying to perfect my bolognese sauce. I built this website using the ```blogdown``` package with Rmarkdown. [You can do it too](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)!
 On most days, you will find me either trying to get my ggplots right, working on my website, or documenting the world around me in pictures.

I am in my final semester at Northeastern University completing my Master of Science in Urban Informatics under [Dr. Dan O’Brien](<https://cssh.northeastern.edu/people/faculty/daniel-t-obrien/>).

I am passionate about transportation & transit analysis, urban design & planning, and data science. Here, you can see these interests combine and display themselves through both academic and professional projects. I am actively searching for work opportunities, and if you like what you see, I’d love to [hear](#contact) from you!
